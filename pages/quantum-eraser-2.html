    We’re depicting it here as a glowing orb, with the caveat that we shouldn’t think of it this way. But that’s sort of the point of this post as we’ll see. Let’s pretend it’s an orb for now.

    When we pass light through two slits, we get the famous interference pattern:

    <double slit>

    This is sort of strange in the sense that, if light is just a bunch of glowing orbs shooting off in a straight line, it’s pretty weird that it makes this pattern. This is suspiciously the kind of pattern you’d get if you had two waves overlapping… but we’re pretty sure that light is more like a small orb. It might be guided by some hidden force that makes it move in a wave pattern, but there has to be some physical object there in a specific location. At some point, the orb has to go through one slit or the other. These seem like reasonable assumptions.

    So what happens if we only shoot one orb out at a time?

    <single photon experiment>

    This is weird. You need two overlapping waves to create an interference pattern. This hidden force makes them each move like a wave, and their waves sort of jostle each other like ripples on a pond to create this pattern. You can’t create an interference pattern with one wave, there has to be two. Does each orb literally go through both slits???

    We would really like to get a closer look at the orbs at this point, things are getting out of hand and its scaring the undergrads. Let’s set up a detector at each slit and watch each orb go through. We can do this because we know light interacts with electrons, but for the purposes of this thought experiment you can  just think of it like a tiny atomic camera.

    <which way experiment>

    Ok, good news and bad news. The good news is the orbs each definitely go through one slit and not both at the same time (because that wouldn’t make any sense!). The bad news is, the interference pattern is gone so we still have no idea what this mysterious force or pattern is that makes the orbs move like waves. Our tiny camera must be affecting the orb in some way.

    Let’s suppose we can make a copy of the orb, so we let the original continue through untouched and we point the camera at the copy instead. We’re not interacting with the original orb at all, only its copy. We can do this by passing the orb through a special type of crystal that splits the orb into two entangled pairs.

    <entangled detection experiment>

    Ok so the orb still doesn’t act like a wave. Our tiny camera might be interacting with the copy orb in a way that makes it stop behaving like a wave, but it’s definitely not doing anything to the original. Remember, we’re trying to figure out why our tiny camera changes the way the light orbs behave. Either the orbs somehow know we’re watching or the camera has a physical effect on the orbs. But we know we’re not affecting the original orb, so… do the orbs know we’re watching? That’s a creepy thought, so let’s swiftly try to rule that out.

    <quantum eraser>

    At this point, we pretty much have to abandon the idea that our tiny camera is interacting with the orb to make it stop behaving like a wave. We’re still using our tiny camera to detect which slit each orb went through, the only difference in this eraser experiment is that we scramble that information after we detect it. It really does seem like something about our knowledge of the orb is affecting its behavior. In fact, we can scramble our copy orb long after the original has hit the screen and it still has the same effect:

    <delayed choice quantum eraser>

    In our quest to basically just figure out what light is made out of, not only have we not answered the question but we appear to be dealing with sentient, time-traveling orbs now. Remember the single orb experiment where we briefly considered that one orb was simultaneously traveling through two slits? That has now become the least insane answer, and actually does explain our delayed choice and eraser experiments.

    Imagine you have two cups in front of you and there’s a ball placed underneath one. You have a 50% chance of finding the ball under either cup, but it’s not like 50% of the ball is under one cup and 50% is under the other. The ball is definitely under one cup, we just don’t know which one. But in our single orb experiment, 50% of the orb literally goes through one slit and 50% goes through the other. That’s how we get two waves from one orb and an interference pattern.

    Likewise in the eraser experiment, an orb goes through every path simultaneously and remains in this ambiguous combination of all possibilities. In the delayed choice experiment, it’s not really that the future affects the past, but that the original orb lives in an indeterminate state until we detect the copy orb.

    <depiction of orbs as a probability distribution>

    In fact, it turns out that all matter behaves this way at the quantum scale and our “orbs” can be electrons, atoms, or even molecules.
